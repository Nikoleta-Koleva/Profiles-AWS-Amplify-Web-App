# React, Vite and AWS Amplify web app

This project contains a React + Vite template, with the minimal setup required to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This app was previously connected to AWS Amplify web hosting and deployed to a globally available content delivery network (CDN) hosted on amplifyapp.com domain.
